Important Note for Your Team: Since we added a Python backend and ignored the large dataset, your teammates (or you on another machine) will need to do two things when they pull this code:

Install Python Dependencies:
bash
pip install -r backend_python/requirements.txt
Get the Dataset: Since India_Locations.csv is ignored, they won't get it automatically. They should either:
Run python backend_python/create_dummy_data.py (to generate a small test file).
Or copy the real India_Locations.csv file into the backend_python folder manually.
If they don't do this, the npm run dev command might show an error for the Python service, but the rest of the app will still work.
